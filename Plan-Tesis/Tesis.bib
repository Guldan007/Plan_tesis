   abstract = {Plastics debris, especially microplastics, have been found worldwide in all marine compartments. Much research has been carried out on adsorbed pollutants on plastic pieces and hydrophobic organic compounds (HOC) associated with microplastics. However, only a few studies have focused on plastic additives. These chemicals are incorporated into plastics from which they can leach out as most of them are not chemically bound. As a consequence of plastic accumulation and fragmentation in oceans, plastic additives could represent an increasing ecotoxicological risk for marine organisms. The present work reviewed the main class of plastic additives identified in the literature, their occurrence in the marine environment, as well as their effects on and transfers to marine organisms. This work identified polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDE), phthalates, nonylphenols (NP), bisphenol A (BPA) and antioxidants as the most common plastic additives found in marine environments. Moreover, transfer of these plastic additives to marine organisms has been demonstrated both in laboratory and field studies. Upcoming research focusing on the toxicity of microplastics should include these plastic additives as potential hazards for marine organisms, and a greater focus on the transport and fate of plastic additives is now required considering that these chemicals may easily leach out from plastics.},

By interfering with the body's endocrine system, endocrine disruptors produce adverse developmental, reproductive, neurological, and immune effects in humans, abnormal growth patterns and neurodevelopmental delays in children. Thus, diethylstilbestrol (DES) a non-steroidal estrogen, which is regarded as a proof of concept, induces clear cell carcinoma among young women. EDCS may be found in plastic bottles and metal food cans (BPA), medical devices (phthalates), detergents, flame retardants (polybrominated diphenyl ethers), food (BPA), toys (phthalates), cosmetics and drugs (parabens), and pesticides (alkyl phenols such as nonylphenol). The deleterious effects of endocrine disruptors constitute a real public health issue.

With the deterioration of eco-environment in China during the past three decades, many studies on PAE occurrence in soils and their risk assessments have been conducted which allow us to carry out a fairly comprehensive assessment of soil PAE contamination on a nation-wide scale. This review combines the updated information available associated with PAE current levels, distribution patterns (including urban soil, rural or agricultural soil, seasonal and vertical variations), potential sources, and human health exposure. The levels of PAEs in soils of China are generally at the high end of the global range, and higher than the grade II limits of the Environmental Quality Standard for soil in China. The most abundant compounds, di-n-butyl phthalate (DBP) and di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), display obvious spatial distribution in different provinces. It is noted that urbanization and industrialization, application of plastic film (especially plastic film mulching in agricultural soil) and fertilizer are the major sources of PAEs in soil. Uptake of PAEs by crops, and human exposure to PAEs via ingestion of soil and vegetables are reviewed, with scientific gaps highlighted.},

   abstract = {Phthalates are used as plasticizers in PVC plastics. As the phthalate plasticizers are not chemically bound to PVC, they can leach, migrate or evaporate into indoor air and atmosphere, foodstuff, other materials, etc. Consumer products containing phthalates can result in human exposure through direct contact and use, indirectly through leaching into other products, or general environmental contamination. Humans are exposed through ingestion, inhalation, and dermal exposure during their whole lifetime, including intrauterine development. This paper presents an overview on current risk assessments done by expert panels as well as on exposure assessment data, based on ambient and on current human biomonitoring results. Some phthalates are reproductive and developmental toxicants in animals and suspected endocrine disruptors in humans. Exposure assessment via modelling ambient data give hints that the exposure of children to phthalates exceeds that in adults. Current human biomonitoring data prove that the tolerable intake of children is exceeded to a considerable degree, in some instances up to 20-fold. Very high exposures to phthalates can occur via medical treatment, i.e. via use of medical devices containing DEHP or medicaments containing DBP phthalate in their coating. Because of their chemical properties exposure to phthalates does not result in bioaccumulation. However, health concern is raised regarding the developmental and/or reproductive toxicity of phthalates, even in environmental concentrations. © 2007 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.},

They are also used in polyvinyl chloride (PVC) plastics to increase durability and plasticity. Phthalates are not present in plastics by covalent bonds and thus can easily leach into the environment and enter the human body by dermal absorption, ingestion, or inhalation. Several in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that phthalates can act as endocrine disruptors and cause moderate reproductive and developmental toxicities. Furthermore, phthalates can pass through the placental barrier and affect the developing fetus. Thus, phthalates have ubiquitous presence in food and environment with potential adverse health effects in humans. This review focusses on studies conducted in the field of toxicogenomics of phthalates and discusses possible transgenerational and multigenerational effects caused by phthalate exposure during any point of the life-cycle.},

In male reproductive health, EDCs have been related to impaired reproductive function and male infertility, altered fetal development, and testicular germ-cell, prostate, and breast cancers. We conducted an electronic search using PubMed on endocrine disruptors related to oxidative stress and male infertility, and evaluated their association with endocrine-disrupting chemicals (bisphenols, phthalates, and parabens) in 25 articles. Higher levels of urinary bisphenols showed correlation with impaired semen quality and increased DNA damage. Considering phthalates and their metabolites, all studies found a positive association between urinary levels of phthalates and at least one semen parameter indicative of low semen quality; some studies also revealed sperm DNA damage. The studies on parabens less often revealed correlation of urinary parabens concentrations with a decrease in sperm count, as well as motility and DNA damage. Moreover, EDCs can elevate ROS production and lipid peroxidation, increase apoptosis, induce epigenetic modifications, and change the Y:X sperm chromosome ratio and sperm protein composition.

   abstract = {Studies indicate that phthalates can disrupt spermatogenesis and lead to the reduction of semen quality. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This study aimed to examine the associations of phthalate exposures as individual chemicals and mixtures with spermatogenesis-related miRNA106a. We detected eight phthalate metabolites in repeated urine samples and a single seminal plasma specimen among 111 men from an infertility clinic in Wuhan, China. Spermatogenesis-related miRNA106a was measured in seminal plasma. We used multivariable linear regression and Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR) models to separately evaluate the associations of phthalate metabolites as individual chemicals and mixtures with spermatogenesis-related miRNA106a. Elevated tertiles of urinary mono (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP) was associated with decreased miRNA106a (−61.71\%; 95\%CI: 81.92, −18.93\% for the highest vs. lowest tertile; P for trend = 0.01). Similarly, an inverse exposure-response relationship between seminal plasma MEHP concentrations and miRNA106a was also observed (−59.44\%; 95\%CI: 79.19, −20.95\% for the highest vs. lowest tertile; P for trend = 0.01). The BKMR models showed that the mixtures of seminal plasma phthalate metabolites were associated with decreased miRNA106a when the chemical mixtures were ≥35th percentile compared to their medians. Nonlinear associations with miRNA106a were estimated for urinary and seminal plasma MEHP while fixing other phthalate metabolites at their medians. Our findings suggest that mixtures of phthalate metabolites in seminal plasma were negatively associated with spermatogenesis-related miRNA106a, and individual MEHP was the major contributor to the adverse effects.},

   abstract = {Endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) are exogenous compounds that have been known for their ability to interfere with the action of hormones and affect endocrine pathways, including the ones involved in the development and function of both male and female reproductive systems. EDCs comprise a wide class of compounds, such as pesticides, bisphenol A, phthalates and, parabens, that are present in the environment and in several daily use products. Phthalate esters, compounds commonly used as plasticizers and additives in many industrial applications, have attracted special attention because of the widespread human exposure and the potential for disruption of androgen-dependent development in males. Although phthalates are rapidly metabolized and excreted, their ubiquitous presence ensures continuous exposures throughout different life stages from conception to adult life, as documented by a number of human biomonitoring studies worldwide. Although most research efforts have been placed on the impact of phthalates on male reproductive development and functions, there is a large body of recent experimental and observational data indicating that phthalates can negatively affect female reproductive health, and in particular alter ovarian and uterine functions, potentially contributing to disorders like polycystic ovarian syndrome, endometriosis, and other common female reproductive problems. This review summarizes the most recent experimental and epidemiologic literature on the potential effects of phthalate exposures on female reproductive health and their impact on female fertility.},

Mutations of androgen receptors (AR) are often found in patients with disorders of male reproductive development, and milder mutations may be responsible for some cases of male infertility. Androgens exert their action through AR and its signalling in the testis is essential for spermatogenesis. AR is not expressed in the developing germ cell lineage so is thought to exert its effects through testicular Sertoli and peri-tubular myoid (PTM) cells. AR signalling in spermatogenesis has been investigated in rodent models where testosterone levels are chemically supressed or models with transgenic disruption of AR. These models have pinpointed the steps of spermatogenesis that require AR signalling, specifically maintenance of spermatogonial numbers, blood-testis barrier integrity, completion of meiosis, adhesion of spermatids and spermiation, together these studies detail the essential nature of androgens in the promotion of male fertility.},

Micaela Buteler Está lloviendo plástico del cielo. Esta expresión no debería ser tan sorprendente si pensamos que se producen más de 380 millones de toneladas de plástico anualmente (el equivalente en peso a un millón de aviones Boeing 747 completamente cargados por año) y tres cuartas partes de ese volumen se descartan como basura. Un pequeño porcentaje de esa cantidad se recicla, otro se incinera y el resto se desecha, acumulándose en vertederos, ríos, y océanos. El plástico es un polímero sintético simple formado por pequeñas moléculas (monómeros, ver Glosario) unidas en una formación repetitiva. Es extremadamente versátil, con propiedades que van desde resistencia a la corrosión, peso ligero, transparencia, hasta la flexibilidad y durabilidad. Los tipos más comunes de plástico incluyen el tereftalato de polietileno (PET), el polietileno (PE), el polipropileno (PP), el poliestireno (PS) y el cloruro de polivinilo (PVC). La producción de plástico está aumentando exponencialmente y, dado que no se biodegrada (ver Glosario), la mayor parte del plástico producido hasta el momento persiste en el ambiente. Desde que comenzó a comercializarse en el siglo pasado hasta ahora, se han producido 7.8 billones de toneladas de plástico, lo que significa que hoy existe una tonelada de plástico por persona en el mundo. ¿Cómo llegó el plástico a invadirlo todo? El plástico comenzó a comercializarse a gran es-cala en la década del '50 del siglo pasado, en la elaboración de productos de la vida cotidiana. Fue una época en la cual la tecnología observó una dramática evolución y en la que la humanidad tenía una fe ciega en ella, esperando que resolviera todos nuestros problemas. Entre otras cosas, en esa década se inventaron el primer microchip, la televisión a color, el modem, la tarjeta de crédito, y se usó por primera vez la vacuna contra la polio. Realmente los avances tecnológicos prometían un progreso creciente para la humanidad. En la misma época, el plástico comenzaba a ganar mercados, producto por producto, y por su practicidad, durabilidad y conveniencia, fue reemplazando al acero en autos, al papel y al vidrio en embalajes, a la lana y al algodón en la ropa, y a la madera en muebles. A partir de los años '70, se gestaron los primeros movimientos ambientalistas, generando por primera vez conciencia sobre los costos ambientales del progreso económico. La reputación del plástico también bajó en los años '70 y '80 a medida que aumentaba la preocupación por los residuos y la noción de que el plástico no se degrada. Sin embargo, la industria petroquímica introdujo el concepto del reciclado y dejó nuestras conciencias tranquilas. Todos recordamos seguramente las "3R: reducir, reusar y reciclar". Así que el plástico siguió entre nosotros sumando usos, ya que, bajo cierta suposición generalizada, o asumida por la mayoría , todo el plástico se recicla. Así, el plástico es todavía considerado como un material maravilloso y su uso siguió creciendo. Recién ahora, estamos comenzando a tomar conciencia y a comprender, lentamente, los problemas que trae aparejado. ¿A qué nos referimos cuando hablamos del "problema del plástico"? El primer y principal problema, del cual derivan todos los problemas de la basura plástica, es que no es biodegradable. Y por biodegradar nos referimos a que no hay organismos que lo transformen en materia orgánica. Pero no nos confundamos: el hecho de que el plástico no sea biodegradable no significa que permanezca intacto por los siglos de los siglos.},

   abstract = {Male infertility is an attracting growing concern owing to decline in sperm quality of men worldwide. Phthalates, in particular to di (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) or its main metabolite mono-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (MEHP), affect male reproductive development and function, which mainly accounts for reduction in male fertility. Lycopene (LYC) is a natural antioxidant agent that has been recognized as a possible therapeutic option for treating male infertility. Testosterone (T)/androgen receptor (AR) signaling pathway is involved in maintaining spermatogenesis and male fertility. How DEHP causes spermatogenesis disturbance and whether LYC could prevent DEHP-induced male reproductive toxicity have remained unclear. Using in vivo and vitro approaches, we demonstrated that DEHP caused T biosynthesis reduction in Leydig cell and secretory function disorder in Sertoli cell, and thereby resulted in spermatogenic impairment. Results also showed that MEHP caused mitochondrial damage and oxidative damage, which imposes a serious threat to the progress of spermatogenesis. However, LYC supplement reversed these changes. Mechanistically, DEHP contributed to male infertility via perturbing T/AR signaling pathway during spermatogenesis. Overall, our study reveals critical role for T/AR signal transduction in male fertility and provides promising insights into the protective role of LYC in phthalate-induced male reproductive disorders.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Chemicals that disrupt the endocrine homeostasis of the human body, otherwise known as endocrine disruptors (EDCs), are found in the blood, urine, amniotic fluid, or adipose tissue. This paper presents the current knowledge about EDCs and the reproductive system. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The article is an overview of the impact of EDCs and their mechanism of action, with particular emphasis on gonads, based on the information available on medical databases (PubMed, Web of Science , EMBASE and Google Scholar, EMBASE and Web of Science) until May 2021. RESULTS: EDCs occur in everyday life, e.g., they are components of adhesives, brake fluids , and flame retardants; they are used in the production of polyvinyl chloride (PVC), plastic food boxes, pacifiers, medicines, cosmetics (bisphenol A, phthalates), hydraulic fluids , printing inks (polychlorinated biphenyls-PCBs), receipts (bisphenol A, BSA) and raincoats (phthalates); they are also a component of polyvinyl products (e.g. toys) (phthalates), air fresheners and cleaning agents (phthalates); moreover, they can be found in the smoke from burning wood (dioxins), and in soil or plants (pesticides). EDCs are part of our diet and can be found in vegetables, fruits, green tea, chocolate and red wine (phytoestrogens). In addition to infertility, they can lead to premature puberty and even cause uterine and ovarian cancer. However, in men, they reduce testosterone levels, reduce the quality of sperm, and cause benign testicular tumors. CONCLUSIONS: Therefore, this article submits that EDCs negatively affect our health, disrupting the functioning of the endocrine system, and particularly affecting the functioning of the gonads.},

We aimed to explore urinary metabolite mixtures of phthalates and PAHs in associations with semen quality. Repeated spot-urine samples gathered from 695 men attending a fertility clinic were analyzed for urinary metabolites of eight phthalates and ten monohydroxylated-PAHs (OH-PAHs). Principal component analysis (PCA)-multivariable linear regression (MLR) model, quantile g-computation (qg-comp), and Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR) were applied to estimate the associations of urinary mixtures of phthalate and OH-PAH metabolites with semen quality. The overall effects of urinary mixtures of phthalate and PAH metabolites on semen quality were not statistically significant. However, hydroxynaphthalene (OHNa) factor identified from PCA was monotonically associated with decreased total sperm count and sperm concentration, whereas di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) factor was non-monotonically related to increased progressive sperm motility and total sperm motility. Qg-comp and BKMR models confirmed these findings and identified 2-OHNa and 2-OHFlu as the primary negative contributors, whereas MEOHP and MEHP as the primary positive contributors. Our findings suggest that exposure to mixtures of naphthalene and DEHP is associated with altered semen quality. The finding is warranted to confirm in further well-designed epidemiological studies.},

The simplest cellular models consider the use of human or animal embryonic stem cells (embryonic or of induced pluripotency) under differentiation and one of the most widely used endpoints in these methods is the alterations in differentiated beating cardiomyocytes, although determination of other molecular markers is also extended. More complex cellular models consider the use of cocultures or 3D cultures or the so-called organoids. These models mimic the physiological environment in a much better way than the simple monolayer cultures. The use of whole embryos allows the determination of which teratogenic effects are expectable after exposure to developmental toxicants, which is one of the main disadvantages of the cellular methods.

Este trabajo presenta un estudio exploratorio y descriptivo sobre la investigación didáctica publicada sobre este tema en el contexto nacional e internacional en la última década empleando la declaración PRISMA para revisiones sistemáticas. El análisis se realizó en una selección de revistas con índices de calidad contrastados en Didáctica de las Ciencias Experimentales (seis españolas y cuatro internacionales). Para cada trabajo se analizó la autoría, su naturaleza como investigación o innovación, los contenidos tratados sobre plásticos, el nivel educativo (infantil, primaria, secundaria o universidad), la metodología empleada (cuantitativa, cualitativa o mixta) y el enfoque de enseñanza (propedéutico o competencial). La revisión muestra que estos trabajos son una minoría en el conjunto de la bibliografía analizada no superando el 3,4% en el ámbito nacional y el 2,3% en el internacional, acaparando investigaciones},

Phthalates, in particular to di (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) or its main metabolite mono-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (MEHP), affect male reproductive development and function, which mainly accounts for reduction in male fertility. Lycopene (LYC) is a natural antioxidant agent that has been recognized as a possible therapeutic option for treating male infertility. Testosterone (T)/androgen receptor (AR) signaling pathway is involved in maintaining spermatogenesis and male fertility. How DEHP causes spermatogenesis disturbance and whether LYC could prevent DEHP-induced male reproductive toxicity have remained unclear. Using in vivo and vitro approaches, we demonstrated that DEHP caused T biosynthesis reduction in Leydig cell and secretory function disorder in Sertoli cell, and thereby resulted in spermatogenic impairment. Results also showed that MEHP caused mitochondrial damage and oxidative damage, which imposes a serious threat to the progress of spermatogenesis. However, LYC supplement reversed these changes. Mechanistically, DEHP contributed to male infertility via perturbing T/AR signaling pathway during spermatogenesis.

Although most research efforts have been placed on the impact of phthalates on male reproductive development and functions, there is a large body of recent experimental and observational data indicating that phthalates can negatively affect female reproductive health, and in particular alter ovarian and uterine functions, potentially contributing to disorders like polycystic ovarian syndrome, endometriosis, and other common female reproductive problems.

In male reproductive health, EDCs have been related to impaired reproductive function and male infertility, altered fetal development, and testicular germ-cell, prostate, and breast cancers. We conducted an electronic search using PubMed on endocrine disruptors related to oxidative stress and male infertility, and evaluated their association with endocrine-disrupting chemicals (bisphenols, phthalates, and parabens) in 25 articles. Higher levels of urinary bisphenols showed correlation with impaired semen quality and increased DNA damage. Considering phthalates and their metabolites, all studies found a positive association between urinary levels of phthalates and at least one semen parameter indicative of low semen quality; some studies also revealed sperm DNA damage. The studies on parabens less often revealed correlation of urinary parabens concentrations with a decrease in sperm count, as well as motility and DNA damage. Moreover, EDCs can elevate ROS production and lipid peroxidation, increase apoptosis, induce epigenetic modifications, and change the Y:X sperm chromosome ratio and sperm protein composition. Our review revealed detrimental effects of EDCs on semen quality and sperm DNA integrity&mdash;especially in BPA and phthalates, but also in parabens.},

   abstract = {It is estimated that infertility affects 8–12% of couples globally, with a male factor being a primary or contributing cause in approximately 50% of couples. Causes of male subfertility vary highly, but can be related to congenital, acquired, or idiopathic factors that impair spermatogenesis. Many health conditions can affect male fertility, which underscores the need for a thorough evaluation of patients to identify treatable or reversible lifestyle factors or medical conditions. Although semen analysis remains the cornerstone for evaluating male infertility, advanced diagnostic tests to investigate sperm quality and function have been developed to improve diagnosis and management. The use of assisted reproductive techniques has also substantially improved the ability of couples with infertility to have biological children. This Seminar aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the assessment and management of men with infertility, along with current controversies and future endeavours.},

   abstract = {Historically, many additives and catalysts used in plastics were based on compounds of toxic metals (and metalloids), like arsenic, cadmium, chromium(VI), and lead. Despite subsequent restrictions, hazardous additives remain in plastics in societal circulation because of the pervasiveness of many products and the more general contamination of recycled goods. However, little is understood about their presence and impacts in the environment, with most studies focusing on the role of plastics in acquiring metals from their surroundings through, for example, adsorption. Accordingly, this paper provides a review of the uses of hazardous, metal-based additives in plastics, the relevant European regulations that have been introduced to restrict or prohibit usage in various sectors, and the likely environmental impacts of hazardous additives once plastics are lost in nature. Examination of the literature reveals widespread occurrence of hazardous metals in environmental plastics, with impacts ranging from contamination of the waste stream to increasing the density and settling rates of material in aquatic systems. A potential concern from an ecotoxicological perspective is the diffusion of metals from the matrix of micro- and nanoplastics under certain physico-chemical conditions, and especially favorable here are the acidic environments encountered in the digestive tract of many animals (birds, fish, mammals) that inadvertently consume plastics. For instance, in vitro studies have shown that the mobilization of Cd and Pb from historical microplastics can greatly exceed concentrations deemed to be safe according to migration limits specified by the current European Toy Safety Directive (17 mg kg−1 and 23 mg kg−1, respectively). When compared with concentrations of metals typically adsorbed to plastics from the environment, the risks from pervasive, historical additives are far more significant.},

   abstract = {Molecular docking predicts whether and how small molecules bind to a macromolecular target using a suitable 3D structure. Scoring functions for structure-based virtual screening primarily aim at discovering which molecules bind to the considered target when these form part of a library with a much higher proportion of non-binders. Classical scoring functions are essentially models building a linear mapping between the features describing a protein–ligand complex and its binding label. Machine learning, a major subfield of artificial intelligence, can also be used to build fast supervised learning models for this task. In this review, we analyzed such machine-learning scoring functions for structure-based virtual screening in the period 2015–2019. We have discussed what the shortcomings of current benchmarks really mean and what valid alternatives have been employed. The latter retrospective studies observed that machine-learning scoring functions were substantially more accurate, in terms of higher hit rates and potencies, than the classical scoring functions they were compared to. Several of these machine-learning scoring functions were also employed in prospective studies, in which mid-nanomolar binders with novel chemical structures were directly discovered without any potency optimization. We have thus highlighted the codes and webservers that are available to build or apply machine-learning scoring functions to prospective structure-based virtual screening studies. A discussion of prospects for future work completes this review. This article is categorized under: Computer and Information Science > Chemoinformatics.},

   abstract = {People are inevitably exposed to phthalates (PEs) ubiquitously existing in environment. Our previous studies, simulating the actual situations of people exposure to PEs, have shown that the sub-chronic exposure to low-doses PEs mixture (MIXPs) impaired reproductive function in male rats. Zinc is an important element in maintaining male reproductive functions. However, it is still unknown whether zinc supplement could mitigate PEs-induced male reproductive toxicity or not with sub-chronic low-dose mixture exposure. This study aimed to explore the effect of zinc supplement on the reproductive toxicity caused by sub-chronic MIXPs exposure (160 mg/(kg•body weight)/d, for 90 days) in male rats, and further to reveal the underlying mechanisms. Testosterone (T), FSH and LH in serum, early toxicity indicators in urine, PIWI proteins (PIWIL1 and PIWIL2) expression in testes and pathological examination were performed for toxicity evaluation. Steroidogenic proteins (17β-HSD, StAR, CYP17A1, P450scc and SRD5A) were measured for mechanisms of exploration. The results indicated that zinc supplement could inhibit the T, LH, FSH level decreases in serum, abolish the effect of 5 early toxicity indicators’ levels in urine, restrain the alteration of PIWI proteins expression and improve the constructional injury of testes. These effects might be relevant with the suppressed alteration of the expression of steroidogenic proteins induced by MIXPs in rat testicular cells. This work may offer further insights into reducing health risks of MIXPs exposure.},

   abstract = {Great attention has been paid in recent years to the harmful effects of various chemicals that interfere with our natural hormone balance, collectively known as endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) or endocrine disruptors. The effects on the reproductive system of bisphenol A (BPA) and phthalates have received particular attention: while they have a short half-life, they are so widespread that human exposure can be considered as continuous. Evidence is often limited to the animal model, disregarding the likelihood of human exposure to a mixture of contaminants. Data from animal models show that maternal exposure probably has harmful effects on the male fetus, with an increased risk of urogenital developmental abnormalities. After birth, exposure is associated with changes in the hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis, hindering the development and function of the male genital pathways through the mediation of inflammatory mechanisms and oxidative stress. The epidemiological and clinical evidence, while generally confirming the association between reproductive abnormalities and some phthalate esters and BPA, is more contradictory, with wildly different findings. The aim of this review is therefore to provide an update of the potential mechanisms of the damage caused by BPA and phthalates to reproductive function and a review of the clinical evidence currently available in the literature.},

Moreover, many authors reported high concentrations of phthalates in soft drinks, mineral waters, wine, oil, ready-to-eat meals, and other products, as a possible consequence of their accumulation along the food production chain and their accidental release from packaging materials. However, due to their different physical and chemical properties, phthalates do not have the same human and environmental impacts and their association to several human diseases is still under debate.

   abstract = {The drug development process is a major challenge in the pharmaceutical industry since it takes a substantial amount of time and money to move through all the phases of developing of a new drug. One extensively used method to minimize the cost and time for the drug development process is computer-aided drug design (CADD). CADD allows better focusing on experiments, which can reduce the time and cost involved in researching new drugs. In this context, structure-based virtual screening (SBVS) is robust and useful and is one of the most promising in silico techniques for drug design. SBVS attempts to predict the best interaction mode between two molecules to form a stable complex, and it uses scoring functions to estimate the force of non-covalent interactions between a ligand and molecular target. Thus, scoring functions are the main reason for the success or failure of SBVS software. Many software programs are used to perform SBVS, and since they use different algorithms, it is possible to obtain different results from different software using the same input. In the last decade, a new technique of SBVS called consensus virtual screening (CVS) has been used in some studies to increase the accuracy of SBVS and to reduce the false positives obtained in these experiments. An indispensable condition to be able to utilize SBVS is the availability of a 3D structure of the target protein. Some virtual databases, such as the Protein Data Bank, have been created to store the 3D structures of molecules. However, sometimes it is not possible to experimentally obtain the 3D structure. In this situation, the homology modeling methodology allows the prediction of the 3D structure of a protein from its amino acid sequence. This review presents an overview of the challenges involved in the use of CADD to perform SBVS, the areas where CADD tools support SBVS, a comparison between the most commonly used tools, and the techniques currently used in an attempt to reduce the time and cost in the drug development process. Finally, the final considerations demonstrate the importance of using SBVS in the drug development process.},

   abstract = {Virtual high throughput screening (vHTS) in drug discovery is a powerful approach to identify hits: when applied successfully, it can be much faster and cheaper than experimental high-throughput screening approaches. However, mainstream vHTS tools have significant limitations: ligand-based methods depend on knowledge of existing chemical matter, while structure-based tools such as docking involve significant approximations that limit their accuracy. Recent advances in scientific methods coupled with dramatic speedups in computational processing with GPUs make this an opportune time to consider the role of more rigorous methods that could improve the predictive power of vHTS workflows. In this Perspective, we assert that alchemical binding free energy methods using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations have matured to the point where they can be applied in virtual screening campaigns as a final scoring stage to prioritize the top molecules for experimental testing. Specifically, we propose that alchemical absolute binding free energy (ABFE) calculations offer the most direct and computationally efficient approach within a rigorous statistical thermodynamic framework for computing binding energies of diverse molecules, as is required for virtual screening. ABFE calculations are particularly attractive for drug discovery at this point in time, where the confluence of large-scale genomics data and insights from chemical biology have unveiled a large number of promising disease targets for which no small molecule binders are known, precluding ligand-based approaches, and where traditional docking approaches have foundered to find progressible chemical matter.},

SUMMARY ANSWER JUNO protein is expressed on the plasma membrane of human oocytes and its inhibition by a monoclonal antibody completely blocks gamete fusion. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY Fusion of gamete membranes is the culminating event of the fertilisation process, but its molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. Until now, three molecules have been shown to be essential: CD9 tetraspanin in the oocyte, Izumo1 protein on the sperm and Juno, its corresponding receptor on the oocyte. Oocyte CD9 and sperm IZUMO1 have been identified in human gametes and their interaction is also well-conserved among several mammalian species. The presence of JUNO on human oocytes, however, has not yet been reported, nor has its role in fertilisation been investigated. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION We selected an anti-human JUNO antibody in order to investigate the presence of JUNO on the oocyte membrane surface and studied its potential involvement in gamete membrane interaction during fertilisation. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS Monoclonal antibodies against human JUNO (anti-hJUNO mAb) were produced by immunisation of mice with HEK cells transfected with the putative human JUNO sequence (HEK-hJUNO). These antibodies were used for immunostaining experiments and in vitro fertilisation assays with human gametes (GERMETHEQUE Biobank). MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE Three hybridoma supernatants, verified by immunostaining, revealed specifically HEK-hJUNO cells. The three purified monoclonal antibodies, FJ2E4 (IgG1), FJ8E8 (IgG1) and FJ4F5 (IgG2a), recognised the soluble recombinant human JUNO protein and, in a western blot of HEK-hJUNO extracts, a protein with an expected MW of 25 kDa. In addition, soluble recombinant human IZUMO protein inhibited the binding of anti-hJUNO mAbs to cells expressing hJUNO. Using these anti-hJUNO mAbs in immunostaining, we identified the presence of JUNO protein at the plasma membrane of human oocytes. Furthermore, we revealed a progressive expression of JUNO according to oocyte maturity. Finally, we showed that human zona-free oocytes, inseminated in the presence of anti-hJUNO mAb, were not fertilised by human sperm. These results suggest that, as seen in the mouse, JUNO is indeed involved in human gamete membrane fusion during fertilisation. LARGE-SCALE DATA N/A. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION In accordance with French bioethics laws, functional tests were performed using zona-free oocytes, which of course does not fully encompass all normal in vivo physiological conditions. However, these in vitro tests do provide direct information regarding sperm-oocyte membrane interactions. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS Mechanisms of gamete fusion appear to be homologous between mice and humans. However, some differences do exist and analysing the human mechanisms is essential. In fact, this is the first report describing the presence of JUNO on human oocytes and its involvement in human fertilisation. This discovery allows further examination of the understanding of molecular mechanisms that drive gamete fusion: a crucial challenge at a time when infertility affects 16% of reproductively active couples.

   abstract = {Acquired resistance to a drug treatment is a common problem across many cancers including prostate cancer (PCa) - one of the major factors for male mortality. The androgen receptor (AR) continues to be the main therapeutic PCa target and despite the success of modern targeted therapies such as enzalutamide, resistance to these drugs eventually develops. The AR has found many ways to adapt to treatments including overexpression and production of functional, constitutively active splice variants. However, of particular importance are point mutations in the ligand binding domain of the protein that convert anti-androgens into potent AR agonists. This mechanism appears to be especially prevalent with the AR in spite of some distant similarities to other hormone nuclear receptors. Despite the AR being one of the most studied and attended targets in cancer, those gain-of-function mutations in the receptor remain a significant challenge for the development of PCa therapies. This drives the need to fully characterize such mutations and to consistently screen PCa patients for their occurrence to prevent adverse reactions to anti-androgen drugs. Novel treatments should also be developed to overcome this resistance mechanism and more attention should be given to the possibility of similar occurrences in other cancers.},

   abstract = {Types of plastic waste in different aquatic environments were assessed to obtain a global framework of plastic waste transport and accumulation, relevant for plastic pollution mitigation strategies in aquatic environments. Packaging and consumer products were the most encountered product categories in rivers, while fishery items dominated in the oceanic environment. Plastics from electronics, building and construction, and transport were barely observed. For polymers, polyethylene and polypropylene contributed most to pollution in all environments. The highest diversity in polymer composition was found in oceanic and freshwater sediments. It is therefore argued that a large fraction of plastic waste accumulates here. This confirms that plastic waste transport and accumulation patterns were most affected by the density, surface area, and size of plastics. Only thick-walled, larger plastic debris from low-density polymers are transported through currents from rivers to ocean, while the larger fraction of plastic litter is likely retained in sediments or beaches.},

   abstract = {Di-n-butyl phthalate (DBP), a plastic-derived, endocrine-disrupting chemical, is regarded as a male reproductive toxicant. In this study, we investigated the in vitro actions of DBP and mono-n-butyl phthalate (MBP, the main metabolite of DBP) on human sperm functions. Human sperm were treated with DBP (2 nM-6 μM), MBP (1 nM-3 μM), and a mixture of DBP and MBP in vitro. The results showed that only DBP at 6 μM, a dose reported in semen of infertile men, MBP at 3 μM (three times of the reported maximum MBP concentration in semen), and their mixture, had obvious adverse effects on sperm motility, penetration ability and capacitation. In addition, these doses of phthalates suppressed human sperm tyrosine phosphorylation, a key signaling pathway that regulates sperm functions. Our findings indicate that DBP and MBP may compromise human sperm functions by inhibiting sperm tyrosine phosphorylation once they accumulate in semen at high levels.},

   abstract = {Humans are exposed to large numbers of environmental chemicals, some of which potentially interfere with the endocrine system. The identification of potential endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) has gained increasing priority in the assessment of environmental hazards. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) has developed the Endocrine Disruptor Screening Program (EDSP) which aims to prioritize and screen potential EDCs. The Toxicity Forecaster (ToxCast) program has generated data using in vitro high-throughput screening (HTS) assays measuring activity of chemicals at multiple points along the androgen receptor (AR) activity pathway. In the present study, using a large and diverse data set of 1667 chemicals provided by the U.S. EPA from the combined ToxCast AR assays in the framework of the Collaborative Modeling Project for Androgen Receptor Activity (CoMPARA). Two models were built using ADMET Predictor™; one is based on Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) technology and the other uses a Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm; one model is a Decision Tree (DT) developed in R; and two models make use of differently combined sets of structural alerts (SAs) automatically extracted by SARpy. We used two strategies to integrate predictions from single models; one is based on a majority vote approach and the other on prediction convergence. These strategies led to enhanced statistical performance in most cases. Moreover, the majority vote approach improved prediction coverage when one or more single models were not able to provide any estimations. This study integrates multiple in silico approaches as a virtual screening tool for use in risk assessment of endocrine disrupting chemicals.},

   abstract = {Phthalates (phthalic acid esters)have been widely applied as plasticizers. They are ubiquitous contaminants in soils, thereby posing a threat to human health. In this study, ecotoxicological effects of three typical PAEs (dimethyl phthalate-DMP, di-n-octyl phthalate-DOP and butyl benzyl phthalate-BBP)were investigated. As a biological indicator, earthworms (Eisenia fetida)were exposed to phthalates at various doses (0, 0.1, 1, 10 and 50 mg/kg)for different times (7, 14, 21, and 28 d). We evaluated the effects of phthalates on reactive oxygen species (ROS)generation, antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase-SOD, peroxidase-POD and catalase-CAT)activities, glutathione S-transferase enzyme (GST)activity, malondialdehyde (MDA)content and DNA damage. Results showed that ROS content increased with increasing phthalates, whereas ROS content generally increased and then decreased with exposure time. However, antioxidant enzymes activities in earthworms displayed different trends. The GST activity in high-dose treatment group was significantly activated. For DMP and DOP, lipid peroxidation mainly occurred between 14 and 28 d, while for BBP, it primarily existed after 7 d and then disappeared after 28 d. Besides, comet assay indicated that there was a dose-response relationship between the DNA damage and phthalate dose, following DMP > DOP > BBP. Given their toxicity, it is important to understand the mechanisms associated with their eco-toxicity and to reduce their adverse impacts on the environment.},

These characteristics have raised the demand for plastic materials that will continue to grow over the coming years. However, with increased plastic materials production, comes increased plastic material wastage creating a number of challenges, as well as opportunities to the waste management industry. The present overview highlights the waste management and pollution challenges, emphasising on the various chemical substances (known as “additives”) contained in all plastic products for enhancing polymer properties and prolonging their life. Despite how useful these additives are in the functionality of polymer products, their potential to contaminate soil, air, water and food is widely documented in literature and described herein. These additives can potentially migrate and undesirably lead to human exposure via e.g. food contact materials, such as packaging. They can, also, be released from plastics during the various recycling and recovery processes and from the products produced from recyclates. Thus, sound recycling has to be performed in such a way as to ensure that emission of substances of high concern and contamination of recycled products is avoided, ensuring environmental and human health protection, at all times.},

In the current paper following phthalates benzylbutyl phthalate (BBP), di- n-butyl phthalate (DBP), di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP), diethyl phthalate (DEP), di-isononyl phthalate (DINP) are described. Phthalates mainly enter to the composition of plastic goods, like boxes and containers for storage of foods, toys, medical devices, and also cosmetics, personal care products, as well as paints, vanishes, printing inks. This paper describes the occurence of individual phthalates in the environment (water, air) and in different products. During production, transportation, manufacturing of goods and improper disposal, phthalates released into soil, water and air. For example indoor air included 13 mg/m3 phthalates, where 72\% of all constitutes DEP (2.29 mg/m(3)), BBP (3.97 mg/m(3)) and DEHP (2.43 mg/m(3)). Exposure to phthalates take place mainly by ingestion or inhalation air or through the skin. Presence of phthalates were observed in numerous food products and is connected with migration of those compounds from food storage containers to preserved food. They could mirgate to salivia during sucking and chewing of toys and this way increased exposure to of children. The results of studies regarding to concentration of phthalates in human tissues and excretions are also described. The level of phthalates were measured in numerous of human biological samples. For example, DEHP, DEP and DBP were detected at levels of 5.71 mg/L in blood serum, of 0.30 mg/L in semen and of 0.72 mg/kg in fat samples.},

   abstract = {STUDY QUESTION Do phthalates create a male reproductive hormone imbalance by down-regulating the secretion of testosterone and insulin-like factor 3 (INSL3)? SUMMARY ANSWER Our study suggests that exposure to phthalates is related to a reduction in the secretion of testosterone and INSL3 in adult males. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY There is evidence that exposure to phthalates, an abundant group of industrial plasticizers, negatively affects testosterone biosynthesis, but little is known about the mechanism in men. The hypothesis that exposure to phthalates reduces the levels of testosterone and INSL3, a marker of Leydig cell function, is underexplored. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION This case-control study of 176 men ran from 2010 to 2012. Infertile men were recruited through infertility clinics in Taiwan, fertile men were recruited from childbirth preparation classes and all were categorized based on the World Health Organization definition of infertility and by the diagnoses of obstetricians. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS Urinary concentrations of 11 phthalate metabolites were measured, along with serum levels of FSH, LH, total testosterone (TT), estradiol, sex hormone-binding globulin and Inhibin B. Androgen status indices including free testosterone (fT) and the free androgen index (FAI) were calculated. The circulating INSL3 level was evaluated using a radioimmunoassay. Non-parametric analyses, trend tests and linear regression models were used. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE Urinary mono-n-butyl phthalate (MnBP), mono-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP) and mono-2-ethyl-5-carboxypentyl phthalate were significantly higher in infertile than in fertile men. Serum Inhibin B, the Inhibin B: FSH ratio, the TT: LH ratio and INSL3 were significantly lower in infertile men. In multiple regression models controlled for potential confounders, there is an inverse association between urinary levels of mono-methyl phthalate (MMP), mono-iso-butyl phthalate (MiBP), MEHP, MEHP\% and serum TT (P = 0.001, 0.007, 0.042 and 0.012, respectively). The inverse associations were also found between urinary levels of MiBP, monobenzyl phthalate (MBzP), MEHP, MEHP\% and serum fT (P = 0.028, 0.017, 0.045 and 0.027, respectively); between urinary levels of MMP, MEHP, MEHP\% and the TT: LH ratio (P = 0.004, 0.029 and 0.039, respectively); between urinary levels of MMP, MiBP, MnBP, MBzP, MEHP and the FAI (P = 0.002, 0.008, 0.037, 0.028, 0.042 and 0.016, respectively). Urinary MBzP and MEHP\% were negatively associated with a decrease in serum INSL3 (P = 0.049 and <0.001). We also observed a strong inverse relationship between MEHP\% quartiles and serum TT, fT, the TT: LH ratio and INSL3 (Ptrend = 0.003, 0.080, 0.002 and 0.012, respectively). Serum INSL3, TT, fT and the TT: LH ratio were lower for men in the highest MEHP\% quartile than in the reference group (P = 0.007, 0.002, 0.090 and 0.001, respectively). LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION A potential limitation is using a single urine and blood sample to predict urinary phthalate metabolites and reproductive hormone status over long periods. However, there is evidence that a single measure provides a reliable result in population studies. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS Non-occupational exposure to phthalates, including di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate, might lead to adverse effects on testicular/Leydig cell function and be of concern owing to the ubiquitous multisource exposure to phthalates among the general population. Although our findings are in agreement with recent experimental data, more studies are required to draw firm conclusions on the relation of INSL3 to phthalate exposure or testicular/Leydig cell function.

   abstract = {In recent years, the impact of environmental exposure to chemicals and their immunological effects, including the development of allergy, has been a topic of great interest. Epidemiologic studies indicate that exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals produced in high volumes, including bisphenol A (BPA) and phthalates, is ubiquitous. The links between their exposure and the development of allergy, asthma, and immune dysfunction have been studied in vitro, in vivo, and through human cohort studies. The purpose of this review is to examine the current body of research and to highlight deficits and strengths of current findings. Emerging science indicates that deleterious immunologic changes, including increased propensity to develop wheeze, allergy, and asthma after dietary and inhalation exposure to these chemicals, may be occurring.},

   abstract = {Objective To review recent evidence relating phthalate exposures to allergies and asthma and to provide an overview for clinicians interested in the relevance of environmental health research to allergy and who may encounter patients with concerns about phthalates from media reports. Data Sources PubMed, TOXLINE, and Web of Science were searched using the term phthalate(s) combined with the keywords allergy, asthma, atopy, and inflammation. Study Selections Articles were selected based on relevance to the goals of this review. Studies that involved humans were prioritized, including routes and levels of exposure, developmental and early-life exposures, immunotoxicity, and the development of allergic disease. Results The general public and those with allergy are exposed to significant levels of phthalates via diet, pharmaceuticals, phthalate-containing products, and ambient indoor environment via air and dust. Intravenous exposures occur through medical equipment. Phthalates are metabolized and excreted quickly in the body with metabolites measured in urine. Phthalates, which are known endocrine disrupting compounds, have been associated with oxidative stress and alterations in cytokine expression. Metabolites in human urine, particularly of the higher-molecular-weight phthalates, have been associated with allergies and asthma in multiple studies. Conclusion Despite mounting evidence implicating phthalates, causation of allergic disease by these compounds cannot currently be established. In utero and early-life exposures and possible transgenerational effects are not well understood. However, considering the current evidence, reducing exposures to phthalates by avoiding processed and foods packaged and stored in plastics, personal care products with phthalates, polyvinyl chloride materials indoors, and reducing home dust is advised. Further longitudinal, molecular, and intervention studies are needed to understand the association between phthalates and allergic disease. © 2014 American College of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology.

   abstract = {Total daily intakes of diethyl phthalate (DEP), di(n-butyl) phthalate (DnBP), di(isobutyl) phthalate (DiBP), butyl benzyl phthalate (BBzP) and di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) were calculated from phthalate metabolite levels measured in the urine of 431 Danish children between 3 and 6 years of age. For each child the intake attributable to exposures in the indoor environment via dust ingestion, inhalation and dermal absorption were estimated from the phthalate levels in the dust collected from the child’s home and daycare center. Based on the urine samples, DEHP had the highest total daily intake (median: 4.42 µg/d/kg-bw) and BBzP the lowest (median: 0.49 µg/d/kg-bw). For DEP, DnBP and DiBP, exposures to air and dust in the indoor environment accounted for approximately 100\%, 15\% and 50\% of the total intake, respectively, with dermal absorption from the gas-phase being the major exposure pathway. More than 90\% of the total intake of BBzP and DEHP came from sources other than indoor air and dust. Daily intake of DnBP and DiBP from all exposure pathways, based on levels of metabolites in urine samples, exceeded the Tolerable Daily Intake (TDI) for 22 and 23 children, respectively. Indoor exposures resulted in an average daily DiBP intake that exceeded the TDI for 14 children. Using the concept of relative cumulative Tolerable Daily Intake (TDIcum), which is applicable for phthalates that have established TDIs based on the same health endpoint, we examined the cumulative total exposure to DnBP, DiBP and DEHP from all pathways; it exceeded the tolerable levels for 30\% of the children. From the three indoor pathways alone, several children had a cumulative intake that exceeded TDIcum. Exposures to phthalates present in the air and dust indoors meaningfully contribute to a child’s total intake of certain phthalates. Such exposures, by themselves, may lead to intakes exceeding current limit values.},

   abstract = {Objective: To evaluate the association between the use of medications potentially containing phthalates and urinary concentrations of specific phthalate metabolites around conception. Methods: Women enrolled in the Environment and Reproductive Health project from 2006 to 2009 completed questionnaires about the use of medications and provided multiple urine samples before and after conception. We compared the mean urinary concentration of phthalate metabolites between users of phthalate containing medications and a matched unexposed control group. Results: One woman used Asacol® (mesalamine), which utilizes dibutyl phthalate (DBP) as a delayed release coating material, and had a mean urinary concentration of the main DBP metabolite 200 times higher than the controls (8176μg/L vs. 37.5μg/L). The three users of stool softeners had a higher concentration of the main diethyl phthalate (DEP) metabolite (8636μg/L vs. 714.2μg/L). Neither the three additional Prilosec® (omeprazole) users nor one cyclobenzaprine user had higher urinary concentration than controls.

   abstract = {Phthalates are suspected of having adverse effects on androgen-regulated reproductive development in animals and may be toxic for human sperm. The purposes of our study were to investigate the general exposure of a Chinese reproductive age cohort to these ubiquitous pollutants and to assess their potential effect on semen quality.Six phthalate metabolites, monomethyl phthalate (MMP), monoethyl phthalate (MEP), monobutyl phthalate (MBP), monobenzyl phthalate (MBzP), mono-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (MEHP), and mono-2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl phthalate (MEOHP) were measured in spot urines of 150 individuals recruited from a Chongqing, China, reproductive institute. The questionnaire and clinical data were evaluated, and the correlations of phthalate exposure and semen qualities like semen volume, sperm concentration, motility and sperm motion parameters, were determined by multiple logistic regression analysis.The creatinine adjusted average concentrations for MMP, MEP, MBP, MBzP, MEHP and MEOHP were 41.3, 300, 41.0, 0.78, 2.99 and 3.90μg/g, respectively. After adjustment for age, body mass index (BMI), abstinence, smoking, drinking, and education, there was a borderline-significant dose-response relationship between MBP and sperm concentration, with odd ratios (ORs) 1.0, 6.8 and 12.0 for increasing exposure tertiles (p=0.05). Although the dose-response relationships for MMP and MEP versus sperm concentration were not significant, a significant positive correlation between MEP and straight-line velocity of sperm motion was observed.The present data may imply some effects of phthalate exposure on semen. However, due to the small sample size, our finding needs to be confirmed on a larger population. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

   abstract = {Various phthalates have been detected in a wide range of food products such as milk, dietary products, fat-enriched food, meat, fish, sea food, beverages, grains, and vegetables as well as in breast milk. Here we present an overview on toxicologically considerable phthalate levels in food reported in the literature. The most common phthalates detected are di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), di-n-butyl phthalate (DnBP), and di-isobutyl phthalate (DiBP). Milk analyses demonstrate that background levels in unprocessed milk are usually low. However, during processing the phthalate contents may significantly increase due to migration from plastic materials in contact with food. Among dietary products fat-enriched food such as cheese and cream were identified with highest levels of DEHP. Plasticized PVC from tubes, conveyor belts, or disposable gloves used in food processing is an important source for contamination of food, especially of fatty food. Paper and cardboard packaging made from recycled fibers are another important source of contamination. In addition, gaskets used in metal lids for glass jars have been identified as possible source for the contamination of foodstuffs with phthalates. The highest concentrations of DEHP reported (>900 mg kg(-1)) were detected in food of high fat content stored in such glass jars. Beyond classical food, DEHP and DnBP were identified in human breast milk samples as the main phthalate contaminants. Phthalate monoesters and some oxidative metabolites were also quantified in breast milk.},

   abstract = {Daily exposure of humans to phthalates may be a health risk because animal experiments have shown these compounds can affect the differentiation and function of the reproductive system. Because milk is the main source of nutrition for infants, knowledge of phthalate levels is important for exposure and risk assessment. Here we describe the development and validation of a quantitative analytical procedure for determination of phthalate metabolites in human milk. The phthalate monoesters investigated were: monomethyl phthalate (mMP), monoethyl phthalate (mEP), mono-n-butyl phthalate (mBP), monobenzyl phthalate (mBzP), mono-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (mEHP), and monoisononyl phthalate (mNP). The method is based on liquid extraction with a mixture of ethyl acetate and cyclohexane (95:5) followed by two-step solid-phase extraction (SPE). Detection and quantification of the phthalate monoesters were accomplished by high-pressure liquid chromatography using a Betasil phenyl column (100 mm×2.1 mm×3 μm) and triple tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS-MS). Detection limits were in the range 0.01 to 0.5 μg L-1 and method variation was from 5 to 15\%. Analysis of 36 milk samples showed that all these phthalates were present, albeit at different concentrations. Median values (μgL-1) obtained were 0.11 (mMP), 0.95 (mEP), 3.5 (mBP), 0.8 (mBzP), 9.5 (mEHP), and 101 (mNP). We also analysed seven samples of consumer milk and ten samples of infant formula. Only mBP and mEHP were detected in these samples, in the ranges 0.6-3.9 μg L-1 (mBP) and 5.6-9.9 μg L-1 (mEHP). © Springer-Verlag 2005.},

   abstract = {In this study, the occurrence of persistent environmental contaminants room air samples from 59 apartments and 74 kindergartens in Berlin were tested in 2000 and 2001 for the presence of phthalates and musk fragrances (polycyclic musks in particular). These substances were also measured in household dust from 30 apartments. The aim of the study was to measure exposure levels in typical central borough apartments, kindergartens and estimate their effects on health. Of phthalates, dibutyl phthalate had the highest concentrations in room air, with median values of 1083 ng/m3 in apartments and 1188 ng/m 3 in kindergartens. With around 80\% of all values, the main phthalate in house dust was diethylhexyl phthalate, with median values of 703 mg/kg (range: 231-1763 mg/kg). No statistically significant correlation could be found between air and dust concentration. Musk compounds were detected in the indoor air of kindergartens with median values of 101 ng/m3 [1,3,4,6,7,8-hexahydro-4,6,6,7,8,8- hexamethylcyclopenta-(g) 2-benzopyrane (HHCB)] and 44 ng/m3 [7-acetyl-1,1,3,4,4,6-hexamethyl-tetraline (AHTN)] and maximum concentrations of up to 299 and 107 ng/m3 respectively. In household dust HHCB and AHTN were detected in 63 and 83\% of the samples with median values of 0.7 and 0.9 mg/kg (Maximum: 11.4 and 3.1 mg/kg) each. On comparing the above phthalate concentrations with presently acceptable tolerable daily intake values (TDI), we are talking about only a small average intake [di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate and diethyl phthalate less than 1 and 8\% of the TDI] by indoor air for children. The dominant intake path was the ingestion of foodstuffs. For certain subsets of the population, notably premature infants (through migration from soft polyvinyl chloride products), children and other patients undergoing medical treatment like dialysis, exchange transfusion, an important additional intake of phthalates must taken into account. © Indoor Air (2003).},
