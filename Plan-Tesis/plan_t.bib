  abstract                   = {Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors have gained recognition as
   effective agents for lowering blood sugar levels, significantly
   improving glycemic control for individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus
   (T2DM). Emodin, an anthraquinone derived from the traditional herbs
   rhubarb (Rheum officinale) and Polygonum cuspidatum, has been identified
   as an important component in the development of new treatments for
   diabetes. In the present work, we explored the DPP-4 inhibitory activity
   of emodin derivatives. This study focused on the design, synthesis, and
   evaluation of emodin derivatives for their in vitro DPP-4 inhibitory
   activity. Molecular docking studies indicated that 3-o-toluoyl emodin
   (OTEM) had the lowest docking score (-134.073) against the DPP-4 protein
   among the tested compounds. OTEM also achieved the highest drug-likeness
   score of 0.56 and demonstrated DPP-4 inhibitory activity, with an IC50
   value of 0.77 mu M. Furthermore, structure-activity relationship (SAR)
   analysis suggested that the addition of an ortho-toluoyl group at the
   C-3 position could enhance DPP-4 inhibition. Additionally, quantitative
   structure-activity relationship (QSAR) model assessments revealed that
   log P was the only descriptor significantly influencing DPP-4 inhibitory
   activity. Therefore, the current study indicates that OTEM could serve
   as a promising lead compound to address the demand for antidiabetic
   agents.},
